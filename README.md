# U.S. Crime & Punishment Regression Analysis  

This project explores the relationship between crime rates and punishment policies across 47 U.S. states.  
It applies multiple regression techniques to evaluate which factors contribute most to crime levels.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **Source:** CrimeAndPunishment.csv (47 U.S. states, crime rates + 15 predictor variables).  

## ðŸ”§ Techniques  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in R
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity  
- Stepwise variable selection  
- Residual & model diagnostics

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights  
- Only 5 of the 15 predictors were statistically significant.  
- Multicollinearity was detected among some punishment-related variables.  
- A simpler model improved interpretability and reduced overfitting.  

## ðŸš€ Skills Demonstrated  
- Regression modeling with R  
- Model diagnostics & variable selection  
- Communicating statistical results
